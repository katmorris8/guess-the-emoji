# Guess the Emoji Game

Hey, Game-Lover! 

Remember the beloved Hasbro board game Guess Who? Well, here's an online, single-player version using emojis!

The emoji to guess will be secretly selected. You will ask questions about the emoji to narrow your options. As your questions are answered, click on emojis that don't have the characteristic to eliminate them. Once you get down to the last emoji, the computer will tell you (with emojis) whether you guessed correctly or not.

But what if you think you know the emoji before they're all eliminated? Click the "Make a Guess" button and select the emoji. We'll tell you if you guessed correctly.

So, do you think you can guess the right emoji?
